This goal of this project was to create a website scraper that could log into a website requiring credentials, scrape the information present and determine according to a set of static criteria if a job available. Why, you might ask? Well, it just so happens that there is a website hosting jobs on a near first-come-first-serve basis. Instead of the user finding him or herself constantly checking the website like a squirrel guarding its acorns, it seems much easier to have a program notify the user. What's even better than that? Receiving the notifications straight to your phone.
